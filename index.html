        <div>
          I am a Software Engineering student passionate about building intelligent systems, combining AI, full-stack
          development, and system design to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working on complex projects such as custom
          programming languages, machine learning applications, and scalable web platforms, and I aspire to become a
          highly specialized software engineer in AI-driven systems and modern application architecture.

            One of my favorite academic experiences has been working on projects together with a team of related,
            especially in machine learning and system design. I particularly enjoyed courses where we combined theory
            with hands-on development of full applications and research-style work.

            I designed and implemented a complete programming language for historical and real-time time-series
            processing. This included building the lexical analyzer, syntax parser, abstract syntax tree, and execution
            logic to enable forecasting-capable analytics through intuitive scripting.

            I worked as a full-stack developer, creating the facial recognition backend (face detection, embeddings,
            enhancement) and a desktop interface for managing student records. The system automatically identifies
            students in crowd images for attendance tracking.
